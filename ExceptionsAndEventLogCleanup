  Description:
  This script is useful if you're trying to track down the status of your EventLog and Exceptions tables. 
  Read these two blog posts for further details

    http://www.dnnsoftware.com/community-blog/cid/155420/dnn-tip-pruning-the-eventlog-with-eventlogconfig
    
  Usage:
  If you running this in SQL Server, instead of via the SQL Console in DNN, you can replace the {databaseOwner}{objectQualifier} tokens.
  {databaseOwner} - If you're using DBO simply replace this with "DBO." (without the quotes).
  {objectQualifier} - If you're not using an object qualifier, replace this with an empty string.

/* get a count of records in the Exceptions table */
select count(1) from {databaseOwner}{objectQualifier}Exceptions with (nolock)


/* get a count of records in the EventLog table */
select count(1) from {databaseOwner}{objectQualifier}EventLog with (nolock)


/* uncomment below to clear out the exceptions table */
--truncate table {databaseOwner}{objectQualifier}Exceptions


/* uncomment below to set all EventLog configurations to only store the most recent 10 events */
--update {databaseOwner}{objectQualifier}Eventlogconfig set keepmostrecent = 10
