  Description:
  This script disables the HTML copyright statement in your DNN install. In DNN9 there is no way to do this without touching the database.

Usage:
  If you running this in SQL Server, instead of via the SQL Console in DNN, you can replace the {databaseOwner}{objectQualifier} tokens.
  {databaseOwner} - If you're using DBO simply replace this with "DBO." (without the quotes).
  {objectQualifier} - If you're not using an object qualifier, replace this with an empty string.
 
*/

Update {databaseOwner}{objectQualifier}HostSettings set settingvalue ='N' where settingname = 'Copyright'
