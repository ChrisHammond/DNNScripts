  Description:
  You can run this script to see where a module is in use. This is useful if you are trying to figure out which pages and portals 
  in a DNN instance are using a specific module.
  
  Usage: Change the @moduleName parameter to provide the name of the module you are looking for. 
  If you running this in SQL Server, instead of via the SQL Console in DNN, you can replace the {databaseOwner}{objectQualifier} tokens.
  {databaseOwner} - If you're using DBO simply replace this with "DBO." (without the quotes).
  {objectQualifier} - If you're not using an object qualifier, replace this with an empty string.
  
  Results: This script will return the TabID, PortalID, Tab Name and Portal Name for any pages that are using a module.
